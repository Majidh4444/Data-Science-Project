# Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, happens when customers stop using a company's services. This is a big issue for telecom companies because of the high competition and how easily customers can switch providers if they're unhappy or find a better deal. Attracting new customers through ads and promotions is expensive, so losing existing customers means losing regular income from monthly bills.

Predicting customer churn is crucial for telecom companies because it helps them develop strategies to keep customers, saving on the costs of acquiring new ones. Retaining customers ensures steady revenue and boosts the company's reputation.

## Project Overview

In this project, we predict customer churn using a telecom dataset from IBM sample Data Sets with three machine learning techniques: **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**. We'll also consider the **Odd Ratio**, a measure used in logistic regression to assess the likelihood of events. These methods are implemented in R.

By accurately predicting churn, telecom companies can make informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to better financial performance and a competitive edge.
